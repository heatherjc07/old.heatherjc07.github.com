  <h1>Finding Your Pushback Style</h1>

  <p>Just a really quick post on some of the things I found interesting in the chapter on &#8220;Finding Your Pushback Style&#8221; from Pushback by Selena Rezvani.</p>

<p>I think one of the biggest things I took from this chapter is that you need to push yourself out of your comfort zone and take opportunities which feel risky. Putting yourself in new situations probably means your will make mistakes. One quote out of the book which I really liked round this was</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;No matter how much of a rockstar you are at your job you won&#8217;t be a rockstar all the time. That&#8217;s okay it just means you&#8217;re challenging yourself&#8221; DeeDee Wilson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>i.e. everyone is human and no one can be perfect all the time. In a way if you find your job easy all of the time, you&#8217;re probably coasting and missing out on opportunities.</p>

<p>The perfectionist in me hates making mistakes and so over time I&#8217;ve had to reprogram myself to put the effect of making a mistake into context. As I mentioned in my previous post weighing it up against the impact of not putting yourself out there can help you get things in to perspective. Becoming resilient and believing that you have what it takes to cope when something happens and finding a way through it are key. You need to be tenacious and not give in at the first challenge.</p>

<p>Another great thing that the chapter covered was the impact your attitude can make on how you cope with challenges and mistakes. For example viewing challenges and having to work on skills as something good that allows you to learn and grow rather than a failing or shortcoming. A growth mindset.</p>

<p>The final theme in the chapter was knowing your brand and how you want to be perceived. The qualities you want people to see in you when you negotiate and the actions you plan to carry out to achieve this. Knowing this and coming back to it when preparing or during negotiations when things get tough and emotions run high helps to ground you and keep you true to yourself. There are lots of exercises in the book to help you work out how you want others to view you.</p>

<p>Next chapter gets in to how to approach a negotiation, Preparing Psychologically. Post about that soon.</p>
