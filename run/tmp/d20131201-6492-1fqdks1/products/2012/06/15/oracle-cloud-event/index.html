  <h1>Oracle Cloud Event</h1>

  <p>Last night the Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison, announced that Oracle Cloud and Oracle Platinum Services are now available. There were lots of jokes, jabs at the competition and throwing around of key cloud terms. Here is a summary of what he talked about.</p>

<h2 id='how_they_got_there'>How they got there</h2>

<ul>
<li>Oracle&#8217;s project Fusion has been rebranded as for the cloud.</li>

<li>It has taken Oracle seven years of development and acquisitions (e.g. Vitrue for Social Marketing ) to get to this position.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='offering'>Offering</h2>

<li>Same platform but run in cloud</li>

<li>Using Oracle products and hardware e.g. Oracle DB, Exadata and Exalogic hardware</li>

<li>Primarily SaaS and PaaS focus</li>

<li>Elastic cloud similar to Amazon Web Services (but claiming to be better&#8230;no surprise)</li>

<li>Highlighted standard cloud advantages, elasticity, speed to provision, cost effective, fault tolerance</li>

<li>Data centres all over the world</li>

<li>Partnered with Cloudera to provide Apache Hadoop distribution and management tool to its Oracle Big Data Appliance</li>

<li>Pricing per month per user</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2 id='differentiators'>Differentiators</h2>

<ul>
<li>Focusing on security (separate data storage, own VM)</li>

<li>Ability to easily move applications from premise to cloud and vice a versa (Supports Hybrid Model)</li>

<li>Ability to upgrade in your own time (Support 2 versions at any one time and give the user a period of time in which to make the move. Initially touted as a year which indicates plans for fewer upgrades than many cloud providers)</li>

<li>Based on open industry standards e.g. SQL, Java, HTML5 etc.</li>

<li>Support Package (see later on)</li>

<li>Providing complete solution to support seamless communication with customers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='competitors'>Competitors</h2>

<ul>
<li>Digs made at SAP for slow move to the cloud and Workday for use of flash and object storage system which makes reporting difficult.</li>

<li>Tools to analysis facebook and twitter logs, see how you are being perceived and tweak marketing if required.</li>

<li>Set up routing, sorting and prioritising rules to respond to data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='support'>Support</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aiming to change the Service Game with Oracle Platinum Services</li>

<li>24/7 monitoring allowing them to be proactive when it comes to issues rather than reactive</li>

<li>Offering this level of service based on the assumption that the resilience and redundancy built into their cloud offering means minimal support calls</li>

<li>Automated support processes to improve response times</li>
