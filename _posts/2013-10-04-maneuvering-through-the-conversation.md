This chapter in Rezvani's book focuses in on the negotiation taking place. The point where you go and have that difficult conversation. 

Here are some of the lessons I took from it
## Remember your right to be there ##

A great phrase in this chapter was

> as an active equal participant

When you're talking to those more senior than you or people with a dominant character it's easy to lose sight of the fact that you're an equal with a right to an opinion. Remembering it is key to having confidence, valuing your own view and speaking up. 

## There is more than one good outcome ##

It's so easy to go into a meeting thinking there is only one desired outcome but that's not true. There are lots of different levels of positive outcomes including ones you've not even considered before the discussion. Aim high (within reason) and know what you are willing to compromise on. Can you concede on something that is of less value to you but will be enough of a gain for the other person to meet you half way.

## Knowledge is Power ##

Don't reveal everything all at once upfront.
