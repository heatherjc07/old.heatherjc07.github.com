  <h1>Explaining Languages through Storytelling</h1>

  <p>Around the time I started up the original version of this blog on Blogger I went on a search for females in technology and I came across Carin Meier and I&#8217;ve been enjoying her tweets ever since. If you have an interest in Clojure you&#8217;ll particularly enjoy following her. Carin&#8217;s passion for Clojure and programming drones with it shines through.</p>

<p>One of Carin&#8217;s talks and a tweet she posted today inspired this post about the power of using stories to teach languages and explain concepts. The first talk that I watched by Carin was <a href='http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Why-is-a-Monad-Like-a-Writing-Desk?'>Why is a Monad Like a Writing Desk</a>. Those of you with an interest in functional programming will probably be aware of what a monad is. I&#8217;d never seen a presentation like this before. It took what could have been a very dry topic and made it accessible. Using a story holds your attention, gets across information in a memorable fashion and helps engage different parts of our brain. The pragmatic book <a href='http://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning'>Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning: Refactor Your Wetware</a> touches on a similar concept of engaging different parts of your brain to help your learn e.g. through modelling with physical objects like lego or drawing a picture (not UML!) of the problem. The fact that Carin&#8217;s talk is based on a story which is familiar to many of us from childhood makes it feel more accessible.</p>

<p>The tweet which inspired this post was about a book called <a href='http://www.realmofracket.com/'>Realm of Racket</a>. Racket is a descendant of Lisp like Clojure. It is an accessible language for beginners interested in learning about functional programming and Lisp. The book teaches you the language through implementing a number of games.</p>

<p>The books uses stories and comics to make what could be a heavy topic lighthearted. Below is an example of part of a story used in the book, taken from a free chapter on <a href='http://nostarch.com/realmofracket'>No Starch</a>.</p>

<p><img alt='sample story from realm of racket' src='/assets/themes//dinky/images/story-telling/realmofracket.gif' /></p>

<p>This acts as an introduction to the problem you are going to solve in your game and helps get you thinking.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to try using storytelling in a future presentation maybe initially within my workplace. I&#8217;d be interested to see how people reacted to it and whether it inspired them and helped them understand something the way Carin&#8217;s talk helped me with Monads.</p>
